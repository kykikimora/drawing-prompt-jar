# Drawing Prompt Jar

## Overview

Drawing Prompt Jar is a full-stack web application practice tool designed to remove the mental friction that keeps artists from drawing consistently. Instead of asking “what should I draw?”, the app eliminates subject choice entirely and replaces it with a simple commitment: select a Creative Limitation, receive a random image, and complete one focused session. The goal is not to produce perfect work, but to practice showing up. By requiring a self-evaluation score at the end of each session, the app reinforces reflection over outcome and reframes mistakes as part of growth. Drawing Prompt Jar exists to help artists build discipline, reduce fear, and reconnect with the process of making art — especially on days when they don’t feel like it.

The application tracks structured session data and demonstrates API integration, backend routing, input validation, and responsive design.

## Capstone Requirements Fulfilled

### Integrate a Third-Party API (Required)

* Uses Unsplash Random Photo endpoint.
* API key stored securely in `.env`.

### Create a Node.js Web Server (Express)

* Serves static files from `public/` directory.
* Custom routes:

  * `GET /api/image  //fetch image from Unsplash API and return selected image data to front end`
  * `POST /api/sessions  //receives session data, validates it, and saves it to data/sessions.json`
  * `GET /api/sessions  //returns all stored session data for use in stats page`

### Analyze and Display Data Stored in Objects/Arrays

* Creative Limitations stored in an array.
* Session objects saved with:

  * `startTime`
  * `endTime`
  * `creativeLimitation`
  * `selfEvaluationScore`

### Validate User Input

* Self-evaluation score restricted to values 1–5.
* Invalid submissions are rejected server-side.

### Responsive Design

* CSS Grid layout.
* At least one media query.
* Mobile and desktop support.

1. Create an account at: [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
2. Create a new application
3. Copy the Access Key into your `.env` file
4. Put that `.env` file into a gitignore file
